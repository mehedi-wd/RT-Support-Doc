/****  Plaese paste it in the functions.php file in the theme *****/
function change_date_format_cb( $string ) {

return $string;
}

add_filter('classima_single_listing_time_format', 'change_date_format_cb', 10, 1);

If it also doesn't work then, It is your server problem, resources are limited not suitable for WordPress site. 

Please! contact with your hosting provider about this problem.

Thank you!


Error 500  is your internal server error!


It is not only our requirements but also WordPress recommendation:
PHP version 5.6 or greater. But for maximum speed gain, we recommend you to use PHP version 7.3+.
MySQL version 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
WordPress memory limit of 128 MB greater.

Please! contact with the hosting provider, they will fix your problem.  It is not our theme related problem.
?
Thanks



Thanks for your interest.

1) Till now theme got 470+ sales we don't save customer url.
2) Yes we have option empty hide
3) Yes based on Elementor. Most of color changed with primary color from admin end some are some Elementor settings.

.mean-container .mean-nav ul li a{

    color: green !important;
}

Error: Internal Server Error (500)

 Normal data import by XML ie our alternative method. It is WordPress default import no relation with the theme. XML data import WordPress default + server related.

If the alternative method does not work ie your server resources are limited not suitable for WordPress site.
?

Please say your hosting provider to give Wordpress friendly hosting, your server resources is limited for WordPress.


Then, if you face any problem, feel free and mail us.

Thank you!



If you have a few minutes, please give a 5-star rating on themeforest.net on the Redchili theme. That will be a great help for our support team.


Regular payment for promotion like Top/ Feature & Bump up

Top => Set ad at the top of the list it shows in random order with a background color.
Featured => These ads show in the list with an icon in left
Bump up => It changes old ads data to current data so it show the top of the list.

Home page is Static Pricing table Elementor addon after creating a package in backend you can create a link in pricing addon button like with "checkout/membership"


If you or your client for single domain develop a site, in this case, need Regular license.

If you use the theme for multiple domains and re-sell to your client, in this case, need Extended license 

See detail https://themeforest.net/licenses/standard


In classified site store mean one users ads show under his user profile with his store information. like this https://www.radiustheme.com/demo/wordpress/themes/classima/store/radiustheme/



I think all standard plugins will work with there own layout style. 








We have two ways to install demo if 1st way fail 2nd way should work see our doc point 3 1&2 https://radiustheme.com/demo/wordpress/eikra/docs/

Check video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7_UcjlPOsM

First you told LMS function not work we use LearnPress LMS plugin it should work cause all users using.

Try 2nd way it should work if not work then send us URL, admin & FTP access I will check.




The map view comes from city, state, address & zip code.

It is auto

when user add this info in listing form map generate auto






1) There's no option of "service" in listing type. Like someone want to list car rental service as it doesn't come under buy or sell.

=> You can add new ad type from admin end

2) I just created a test listing type, but there's no option to add features in that. 

=> Custom fields depend on category not ad type. which feature you mean?

3) How can i create a category "Personals" without any monetary values, like men seeking women and women seeking men.

=> Create category by name

4) Does theme support adsense ?

=> Yes support

Sorry for the late response.


Thank you so much for your patience.

We have lots of clients so it is difficult to respond immediately.

Thanks again and congrats for solving the problem yourself.



Alternative is default XML import it will not show this type of error. The alternative should work it may give a different error if server resources are limited.

Please check server PHP version, Memory & Execution limit.
In top search use auto suggestion layout.


It is not theme related problem. If server resources are limited, then it shows this type of error. Increase your execution time limit.

Follow this alternative demo import process: https://www.radiustheme.com/demo/wordpress/themes/metro/docs/#demo-alt


The alternative is default XML import it will not show this type of error. If it is also showing error, contact with your hosting provider.

Say them to check and update server PHP version, Memory & Execution limit.
Say them to check and update server PHP version(7+) , Memory(512) & Max Execution limit (300).

Add this CSS in Appearance => customize => additional CSS 

.main-header .main-navigation-area .main-navigation ul li.mega-menu:hover ul{

}

.main-header .main-navigation-area .main-navigation ul li ul li:hover > a {
    color: #ffffff;
    background-color: #7b0a0a;
}

Our system work like this way
?
1) Post free ads then pay for promotion like top, featured ads
?
2) Membership like 30 ads $40 for 30 days in membership has option to set some free ads. If set some free ads then after post no of free ads user need to purchase a membership. But promotion is still different after post ads promotion come.
